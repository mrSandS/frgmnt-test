# frgmnt-test

Estimated time - 2h, Spent time - 1.5h (not including convertor - bonus task).

Task 2 main code is in js/main.js file. Additionally, you can find a convertor (please open index.html to check it). I didn't use React for it as the main purpose was to implement the logic itself, so it's written in pure js.

The convertor takes all the data from task2.json file. It's scalable, so you can add as many currencies and pairs as you wish.
