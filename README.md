# frgmnt-test

Estimated time - 2h, Spent time - 1.5h (not including convertor - bonus task).

Task 2 main code is in js/main.js file. Additionaly you can find a convertor (please open index.html to check it). I didn't use React for it as the main purpose was to implement the logic itself so it's written in pure js.

The convertor takes all the data from task2.json file. It's absolutely scalable so you can add as much currencies and pairs as you wish.
